# Summary

RDM Refunder is a script that aims to mitigate the losses of one of the biggest flaws in DarkRP; RDM.
The RDM Refunder allows you to refund your players in the event of RDM to keep them happy and motivated to play on your server. Lots of players join your server and lots of players also quit, this script will remove one of the key reasons your players are quitting.
RDM Refunder has a simple UI which allows you to quickly refund your players and get them back to their roleplay experience, it is very simple allowing your admins to quickly make your disgruntled players happy. Admins can easily identify lives as RDM Refunder logs when a player died; this allows you to check against your general logs and make the nessecary decisions.
